## About this repo
This is the home of my personal blog project, [She Builds With Code](https://shebuildswithcode.com). On the blog, I discuss everything I've learned while learning to code. I decided the site itself would also be a bit of a showcase of what I'm learning as I'm going. 

So the site will have 3 versions:
1. A complete [static](https://github.com/elleon003/she-builds-with-code/tree/master/v1_static_site) site, where I built it with Bootstrap and update all files manually
2. A [site](https://github.com/elleon003/she-builds-with-code/tree/master/v2_pelican) built with [Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/), which is a site generator based in Python, making my site updates a little easier. :-)
3. A custom blog app, built with [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/). I plan to learn a lot with that!
