		<p>Welcome! This site is an experiment as I apply what I'm learning as a web developer.</p>
		<p>I've been "learning" for years, but to date I've done very little with it. I've built very little, mainly
			bouncing between tutorials and Udemy courses. Each time walking away a little more frustrated, just because I
			wasn't really applying what I was learning.</p>
		<p>Like many of us that want to learn to code, we start with really big ideas, ways we can really change things if
			we have the tools to build it ourselves. And it's really exciting in the beginning, taking starter courses,
			dabbling on Codecademy or FreeCodeCamp and really seeing the results on the screen.</p>
		<p>Then you sit down to build on your own....and you're so stuck you want to cry. You can't even remember how to
			start an HTML doc! How do you link a CSS file? And how do I get an image on this page??</p>
		<p>Recently, while listening to the <a href="https://fizzle.co/sparkline/name-picking-paralysis" target="_blank">Fizzle Podcast</a> (a site to help entrepreneurs start and grow their businesses),
			I heard them say "published is better than perfect." It smacked me in the face. I'd been too busy worrying about
			getting it just right that I never really bothered to get started.</p>
		<p>To learn something, and honestly own it, you've got to do it. All the tutorials, books, podcasts, blog posts
			and audio books in the world ain't worth nothing until you take action.</p>
		<p>So, this site is going to be constantly evolving, until I have successfully built a custom CMS for it. I'm
			completely terrified, but excited to have something specific to aim for.</p>
		<p>The goal is to learn by doing, by building something that matters to me. And for those following along, I hope
			it helps in your own journey. Whether it helps you to not feel alone, or helps you see all the things you should
			never do, there should be lessons for us all in this!</p>
