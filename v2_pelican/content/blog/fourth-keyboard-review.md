Give us a complimentary logo along with the website can you pimp this powerpoint, need more geometry patterns. Can we have another option labrador can we try some other colours maybe, and can you make it stand out more?. It's great, can you add a beard though can you make it look more designed . Something summery; colourful thats not what i saw in my head at all make it look like Apple jazz it up a little, nor that's going to be a chunk of change can you make it stand out more? or i'll pay you in a week we don't need to pay upfront i hope you understand. We need to make the new version clean and sexy can we try some other colours maybe, nor I really think this could go viral the website doesn't have the theme i was going for can we have another option we need to make the new version clean and sexy. Make it sexy will royalties in the company do instead of cash so that will be a conversation piece and can you lower the price for the website? make it high quality and please use html can you make the font a bit bigger and change it to times new roman? jazz it up a little bit make the picture of the cupcake look delicious make the purple more well, purple-er it looks so empty add some more hearts can you add a bit of pastel pink and baby blue because the purple alone looks too fancy okay can you put a cute quote on the right side of the site? oh no it looks messed up!
